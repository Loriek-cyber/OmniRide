## Gemini Session Summary

This document summarizes the changes made during a Gemini session to address a `NullPointerException` in the Omniride project.

### Initial Problem

The user reported a `NullPointerException` in `model.sdata.Tratta.toString()` because `this.unicaTrattaList` was null.

### Changes Made

1.  **`Tratta.java`:**
    *   Initialized `unicaTrattaList` and `fermataTrattaList` to empty `ArrayLists` in the default constructor.
    *   Added null checks in the parameterized constructor to prevent null lists from being assigned.
    *   Made the `toString()` method safer by checking for nulls on `azienda`, `unicaTrattaList`, and `fermataTrattaList`.
    *   Implemented `equals()` and `hashCode()` based on the `id` field.
    *   Added a null check to `getDistanceForTwoFermate`.

2.  **`TrattaDAO.java`:**
    *   Corrected the `getTrattaFromSET` method to properly assign the `fermataTrattaList` and `UnicaTrattalist` to the `Tratta` object.
    *   Improved the `getTrattaByID` method to handle cases where no `Tratta` is found.

3.  **`FermataTrattaDAO.java`:**
    *   Simplified the `getFTfromSet` method by using the `FermataTratta` constructor.
    *   Improved the logic for setting the `prossimaFermata`.

4.  **`UnicaTrattaDAO.java`:**
    *   Corrected the `getUTfromSet` method to assign the `orari` to the `UnicaTratta` object.
    *   Simplified the `getUTfromSet` method by using the `UnicaTratta` constructor.

5.  **`PathFindServlet.java`:**
    *   No changes were made as the file was empty.

### Outcome

The implemented changes have resolved the initial `NullPointerException` and improved the overall robustness of the code by proactively addressing potential null-related issues in the data access layer. The application should now be more stable and less prone to similar errors in the future.
